constructive criticism sandwich example:

    Great job so far on your project. You've added comments before each function in your program - it's easy for me to understand how your code works. You've also formatted your code by indenting nested structures,which is great for readability.

    However, on line 34, it looks like your using the wrong comparison operator. This makes an infinite loop and is crashing the program.

    Overall your code is well written and easy to read. Excellent work!


not as good feedback:

    You've got a syntax error on lines 3 and 34 and 45 and 108...

Better feedback:

    I've noticed that you've got a few syntax errors in your code, like the one on line 3. I reccommend running your code through a validator just to make sure you've caught all of those little errors.

"Needs Work" Feedback:
    - Explain what needs to be fixed
    - Guide the student toward a solution
    - Provide resources or examples

    example:

        You've done a great job completing this requirement, but I see a small problem.

        It looks like your code has a few single letter variables. these should be avoided because it can make your code difficult to read and follow.

        It's really helpful for code readability if variable names describe the values they hold. For example, on line 2, you could name your variable studentList instead of a single letter.

        Here's a great article I found on common ways developers name variables.

        Overall, your code is well-organized and easy to read, so very well done!
