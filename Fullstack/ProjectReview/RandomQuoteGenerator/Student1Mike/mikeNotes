"Hi,

I tried to make the timer so that it would be reset using a function every time the button is clicked, so that there would always be 10s between each quote whether left to auto change, or after the click. I believe it's working, but not sure if I did it in the most effective way?

Also the hex generator for the background colour is from the referenced blog post, I hope there's no problem with this.?

Thanks,

Mike"
